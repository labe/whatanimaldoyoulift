Inspired by ["What cat can you lift?"](http://i.imgur.com/rpo7B6Y.jpg) and ["What bear can you lift?"](http://i.imgur.com/HYFCNQf.jpg) via [r/xxfitness](http://www.reddit.com/r/xxfitness/) and by [this dude](https://github.com/ezy023) who has assured me that next time I visit Chicago, we will be picking things up and putting them down.

With authority. [1]
